Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) Debugger

Editor/Debugger for testing Proxy Auto-Config files.

Version History:
1.0.2.0: Added start menu program group in Setup.
         No change to code.
1.0.1.0: Fixed bug with compiling JavaScript in
         the editor.
1.0.0.0: Initial version for release.

Things to know:
- Always put 'var' in front of variable
  definition.

- You can use the internal command, 
  __logMessages() to display debugging
  statements. Of course, 
  these are not valid in actual PAC files
  and should be removed prior to use.

  Example:
    var s='This is a string';
    __logMessage('s='+s+'\n');
  Displays in output:
    s=This is a string

- If you use FindProxyForURLEx(url, host), you
  must change the name of the entry function to
  the same.
